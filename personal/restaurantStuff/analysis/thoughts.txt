ideas for this:
    array[][]
        columns = columns from the pdf, rows = rows from pdf


    reading / writing
        write to report with name "reportmmddyyyy"
        read from previous report when you go to compare with previous week

    MAIN ISSUES:
        reading and storing data from weekly report
            how are we going to store the information from the pdf?
                parse through unnecessary chars and store the important ones.
                do we store values in the order they appear or in a pre determined order?
                    if we do it in a pre determined order, it makes comparisons with other weeks more easily.
                        clunkier code  
                        what happens if they add a new menu item?
                        specials for the week?
                    if we do it in the order it appears in the pdf, it makes the code much less clunky.
                        this is likely the approach we should take
                        class item{
                            private:
                                int type; //type will represent what type of item it is. e.g. 1 = food, 2 = beer, 3 = cocktail
                                string name;
                                double total;
                                double percentCat;
                                double percentTot;
                        }
                        while(!eof){
                            cin >> name >> total >> percentCat >> percentTot;
                        }
                    

        creating a report of our own in order to have persistent storage for the program.
