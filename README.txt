hello world!

  i'm dausen, at the moment of writing this i'm 21 years old, with a decent amount of prior experience with using git
and 3 years of programming experience under my belt. currently i'm a junior cs student at the university of alabama
and will hopefully graduate college at some point. 

  i'm creating this repository with the idea that this will be much more ogranized than my original repository (the original
quickly got out of hand, full of unorganized files and stuff i probably won't even need. also it was on bitbucket (gross, i know)).
this repository will hopefully serve as a portfolio of sorts for me in the future, but honestly, at the moment, my only plans for it
are to allow myself to work on projects on my at home desktop pc as well as on my laptop whenever i'm away from home. before i started
using git, my form of version control was emailing .cpp files to myself every time i got done working so that i could download it on
my laptop/desktop at a later time. needless to say this is much easier.

  if you're checking this out and you're not a friend working on a project with me, welcome! hopefully you find my projects
impressive and exciting (especially if i've applied to work for you).

  thank you for taking the time to check out my repository!
