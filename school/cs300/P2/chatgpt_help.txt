To retrieve data from the BACKING_STORE.bin file using a physical address from addresses.txt, you can follow these steps:

Open the BACKING_STORE.bin file in binary mode using fopen() function.

Open the addresses.txt file in text mode using fopen() function.

Read a physical address from addresses.txt file using fscanf() function.

Calculate the corresponding page number and offset within the page using the formula: page_number = physical_address / 256 and offset = physical_address % 256.

Seek to the starting position of the page in BACKING_STORE.bin file using fseek() function. The starting position of the page can be calculated as page_start = page_number * 256.

Read the entire page from BACKING_STORE.bin file into a buffer using fread() function.

Access the required data from the buffer using the calculated offset.

Repeat steps 3 to 7 until all physical addresses have been processed.

Close the addresses.txt and BACKING_STORE.bin files using fclose() function.

Here is an example implementation of the above steps:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

#define PAGE_SIZE 256

int main()
{
    // Open BACKING_STORE.bin file
    FILE *bs_file = fopen("BACKING_STORE.bin", "rb");
    if (bs_file == NULL) {
        printf("Error: Unable to open BACKING_STORE.bin\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Open addresses.txt file
    FILE *addr_file = fopen("addresses.txt", "r");
    if (addr_file == NULL) {
        printf("Error: Unable to open addresses.txt\n");
        fclose(bs_file);
        return 1;
    }

    // Buffer to hold a page of data
    unsigned char page[PAGE_SIZE];

    // Read physical addresses from addresses.txt and retrieve data from BACKING_STORE.bin
    int physical_address;
    while (fscanf(addr_file, "%d", &physical_address) == 1) {
        // Calculate the page number and offset within the page
        int page_number = physical_address / PAGE_SIZE;
        int offset = physical_address % PAGE_SIZE;

        // Seek to the starting position of the page in BACKING_STORE.bin
        fseek(bs_file, page_number * PAGE_SIZE, SEEK_SET);

        // Read the entire page into the buffer
        fread(page, PAGE_SIZE, 1, bs_file);

        // Access the required data from the buffer using the offset
        unsigned char data = page[offset];

        // Print the retrieved data
        printf("Physical Address: %d, Value: %d\n", physical_address, data);
    }

    // Close the files
    fclose(addr_file);
    fclose(bs_file);

    return 0;
}
Note that this implementation assumes that addresses.txt contains one physical address per line, and that each physical address is a non-negative integer. You may need to modify the implementation to suit your specific use case.
